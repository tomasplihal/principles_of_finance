## Investing in Stocks

- Similar to bonds, common stocks give investors a claim on a company's future
earnings and cash flows.
- Unlike bonds, common stocks do not have maturity dates, face values, or
guaranteed coupon payments.
- Common stocks might pay dividends, but these are not promised and can vary
based on the decisions of the company's board.
- Investing in stocks is generally riskier than bonds or other fixed-income
investments because there is no guarantee of payments to investors.
- Common reasons for investing in stocks are to maintain value, accumulate
wealth over time, and earn income through capital gains and dividends.
- Advantages of stock investments include potentially substantial returns
through dividends and share price appreciation, liquidity, and the availability
of information about companies and markets.
- Disadvantages include greater risk levels compared to fixed-income
investments, difficulty in timing buy-and-sell transactions, and uncertainty
around dividend payments.

## Multiple Approaches to Stock Valuation

### The Price-to Earnings (P/E) Ratio

- Investors use various methods to evaluate companies and their common stock,
including studying financial statements and calculating financial ratios.
- The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a crucial metric used to assess the
market value of a company's stock.
- The P/E ratio is calculated as: 
$$
\text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{Price per Share}}{\text{Earnings per Share}}
$$
- The P/E ratio represents the price an investor pays for each unit of a
company's current or future earnings.
- P/E ratios can be trailing (based on past earnings) or forward (based on
projected future earnings).
- For example, if a company's stock price is $24.00 and its EPS is $4.00, its
P/E ratio is calculated as:
$$
\text{P/E} = \frac{\$24.00}{\$4.00} = 6
$$
- Indicating that investors are willing to pay up to six dollars for every
dollar of earnings.
- A company's P/E ratio should be compared to historical P/E ratios or the P/E
ratios of other companies in the same industry for meaningful analysis.
- High P/E ratios may suggest a company is overvalued and prone to price
adjustment, while low P/E ratios may indicate undervaluation and opportunity for
investment gains.
- Care must be taken as the current stock price may not align with the company’s
earning potential, necessitating the use of multiple evaluation techniques for
stock analysis.
- Look at the 90-year historical average P/E ratio of the S&P 500
<https://openstax.org/r/90-year_historical_average_P/E>

### The Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio

- The Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio is a common financial metric used to evaluate a
company's market value relative to its book value.
- The market value is the current price of all a company's outstanding shares,
while the book value represents the company's residual value after liquidating
assets and paying off liabilities.
- The P/B ratio is calculated as:
$$
\text{P/B Ratio} = \frac{\text{Market Price per Share}}{\text{Book Value per Share}}
$$
- P/B ratio is often used to evaluate financial services firms, but it has the
limitation of not accounting for intangible assets like patents, trademarks, and
copyrights.
- P/B ratio can also be calculated by either:
$$
\text{P/B Ratio} = \frac{\text{Market Capitalization}}{\text{Net Book Value}}
$$
$$
\text{P/B Ratio} = \frac{\text{Price per Share}}{\text{Net Book Value per Share}}
$$
  where the net book value equals total assets minus total liabilities.
- A low P/B ratio (less than 1) might indicate a stock is undervalued, while a
high ratio (greater than 1) might suggest overvaluation. However,
interpretations vary among market experts.
- P/B ratio should be used in conjunction with other metrics and compared with
P/B ratios of companies within the same industry for a comprehensive analysis.

### Alternative Multipliers

- There are two main types of valuation multiples used for stock evaluation:
equity multiples and enterprise value (EV) multiples. 
- Equity multiples include the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, price-to-book
(P/B), market-to-book (M/B) ratio, dividend yield, price-to-sales (P/S) ratio,
and price-to-cash-flow (P/CF) ratio.
- EV multiples are used primarily for valuations involving mergers and
acquisitions and provide a more comprehensive measure of a company's total value
than market capitalization.
- Common EV multiples include:
  - Enterprise Value to Revenue
  $$
  \frac{\text{Enterprise Value}}{\text{Revenue}}
  $$
  - Enterprise Value to Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)
  $$
  \frac{\text{Enterprise Value}}{\text{EBIT}}
  $$
  - Enterprise Value to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA)
  $$
  \frac{\text{Enterprise Value}}{\text{EBITDA}}
  $$
  - Enterprise Value to Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, Amortization, and Rental Costs (EV/EBITDAR)
  $$
  \frac{\text{Enterprise Value}}{\text{EBITDAR}}
  $$
- Despite their usefulness, these multiples are snapshots in time and may mask
important factors influencing the company's value.
- To avoid misinterpretation and erroneous investment decisions, it's vital to
use multiple ratios and alternate measures in company evaluations.

## Dividend Discount Models (DDMs)

- The Dividend Discount Model (DDM) is used to value a stock based on the
present value of its future dividends.
- Both the Zero and Constant Growth models have limitations due to their
assumptions of fixed dividend and growth rates. These models are most suitable
for stocks with a consistent dividend payment history.

### The Gordon Growth Model 

- The most common DDM is the Gordon Growth Model (Constant Growth Dividend
Discount Model), which uses the following formula:
$$
\text{Stock Value} = \frac{D_0 (1+g)}{r - g} = \frac{D_1}{r - g}
$$

  where $D_1$ is the dividend for the next year, $r$ is the required return, and
  $g$ is the estimated future dividend growth rate.

### Zero Growth Dividend Discount Model

- The Zero Growth Dividend Discount Model assumes that future dividends will be
the same forever.
- Its formula is similar to calculating the present value of a perpetuity:
$$
\text{Stock Value} = \frac{\text{Annual Dividends}}{\text{Required Rate of Return}} = \frac{D}{r}
$$

### Numerical Example

- Suppose a company just paid a dividend $D_0$ of $\$2.00$, the dividends are
expected to grow $g$ at 5% per year, and your required rate of return $r$ is
10%. The price of the stock can be calculated as:

$$
P = \frac{2.00(1 + 0.05)}{0.10 - 0.05} = \frac{2.10}{0.05} = \$42.00
$$

- Thus, according to the Constant Growth Dividend Discount Model, the price of
the stock should be \$42.00. If the market price is lower than this, it might be
a good investment opportunity (assuming the model's assumptions hold true and
other factors are favourable).

### Variable or Nonconstant Growth Dividend Discount Model

- The Variable or Nonconstant Growth Dividend Discount Model is a more realistic
model that assumes that a company and its stock value will progress through
different stages of growth.
- This model calculates the present value for each growth period and then sums
them up to get the intrinsic value of the stock.
- The formula for variable growth DDM extends the constant growth model to each
growth period. The present value of dividends for each period is calculated and
summed up.
- For example, if Maddox Inc. has a dividend of $2.00 last year, a dividend
growth rate of 5% for the next four years, and a steady growth rate of 3% after
that, with a required rate of return of 8%, the stock value can be calculated as
shown in the following table:

|Year | Growth % | Dividend  (\$) | Value after Year 4 (\$) | PV Discount Factor at 8% | Present Value of Dividend (\$) |
|-----|----------|---------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
|  0  |   5%     |   2.00        |                        |                          |                               |
|  1  |   5%     |   2.10        |                        |   1.0800                 | 1.9444                        |
|  2  |   5%     |   2.21        |                        |   1.1664                 | 1.8904                        |
|  3  |   5%     |   2.32        |                        |   1.2597                 | 1.8379                        |
|  4  |   5%     |   2.43        |                        |   1.3605                 | 1.7869                        |
|  5  |   3%     |   2.50        | 50.07886               |   1.4693                 | 35.7870                       |

where 
$$
\text{Value after Year 4} = \frac{2.43 (1 + 0.03)}{0.08 - 0.03} = 50.078858
$$
- The intrinsic value of the stock based on the variable growth model would be
the sum of present value of dividends, \$43.25 per share.

### Advantages and Limitations of DDMs

#### Advantages

- Dividend Discount Models (DDMs) have several advantages, including their
foundation in present value concepts, consistency, and the indication that
dividend-paying companies are usually mature and stable.
- DDMs provide a mathematical formula, reducing the chance of misinterpretation
or subjectivity.
- Companies may maintain dividend payments, even when not beneficial in the
long-term, to avoid stock price volatility.

#### Limitations

- One of the main limitations of DDMs is their inability to value companies that
do not pay dividends, which is a growing trend especially among young tech
companies.
- Renowned investor Warren Buffett advises companies to reinvest excess funds
into infrastructure and other profitable ventures rather than paying dividends,
a practice followed by companies like Amazon, Google, and Biogen.
- The fair price of a stock according to DDMs can be highly sensitive to changes
in growth rates and required rates of return. A small change in these factors
can significantly impact a company's stock price.
- The results obtained using DDMs may not necessarily align with a company's
operations or profitability. Some companies maintain a stable dividend payout
through increased borrowing and debt, which is detrimental to their long-term
financial health.

### Final Thoughts on Dividend Discount Models

- The Dividend Discount Model (DDM) is most useful for valuing companies with
long and consistent dividend records, as it relies on expected future payouts
and dividend growth.
- Applying the DDM to companies with limited dividend history, or those in
high-risk industries, may result in inaccuracies in the derived value.
- While dividend models align with the fundamental concept of asset
pricing—valuing financial assets based on future cash flows and the required
rate of return—they can pose challenges due to the uncertainty of predicting the
timing and amounts of these future cash flows.

## Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model

- Stock investors seek future cash inflows from dividends and profit from
selling the stock.
- The sale price of the stock is ideally higher than the purchase price,
resulting in a capital gain. This hope for capital gains is stronger for stocks
that do not pay dividends.
- Stocks not paying dividends are desirable if held over a year due to lower
long-term capital gains tax.
- Short-term gains on securities are taxed at ordinary income rates.
- The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, often used for non-dividend-paying firms
like Facebook or Amazon, values a company based on its cash flows.
- Unlike Dividend Discount Models (DDMs), the DCF model evaluates a company
individually, making it less prone to accounting manipulations.
- The DCF model calculates a company's present value and per-share value.
- The DCF model is represented by the following equation:

$$
\text{Stock Value} = \frac{CF_1}{(1+r)^1} + \frac{CF_2}{(1+r)^2} + \frac{CF_3}{(1+r)^3} + \dots + \frac{CF_n}{(1+r)^n}
$$

- where:
  - $CF_n$ is the cash flow expected in period $n$,
  - $r$ is the discount rate (also known as the required rate of return),
  - $n$ is the number of periods.
- Alternatively, the last term $CF_n$ could be replaced with the Terminal Cash
Flow (TCF), defined as $\frac{TFC}{r-g}$.
- In the context of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for stock pricing, the
Terminal Cash Flow (TCF) represents the present value of all cash flows a
company is expected to generate beyond a certain forecast period. 
- The DCF model is then represented by the following equation:

$$
\text{Stock Value} = \frac{CF_1}{(1+r)^1} + \frac{CF_2}{(1+r)^2} + \frac{CF_3}{(1+r)^3} + \dots + \frac{\frac{TFC}{r-g}}{(1+r)^n}
$$

### Applying the DCF Model

- The DCF model can be applied to determine the value of Mayweather Inc. using
given cash flow results, a discount rate of 8%, a growth rate of 3%, and a
terminal value (TCF) equal to 2.5 times the discounted value of the cash flow in
year 6.
- With a cash flow of \$2.0 million in year 1, the discounted cash flow after
one year (CF1) is \$1,851,851.85.
- Mayweather's cash flow increases by 3% in subsequent years.
- Discounted cash flow amounts over the next six years are as follows:

| Year | Discounted Cashflow |
|:----:|:-------------------:|
| 1    | \$1,851,852         |
| 2    | \$1,766,118         |
| 3    | \$1,684,353         |
| 4    | \$1,606,374         |
| 5    | \$1,532,005         |
| 6    | \$1,461,079         |

- The terminal cash flow (TCF) is 2.5 times the value in the sixth year, or
\$3,652,697.
- Adding all these discounted cash flows, the total value of Mayweather Inc. is
approximately \$13.5 million.
- If Mayweather is currently trading at \$12 per share with 1,000,000 common
shares outstanding, the market capitalization is \$12 million.
- Given the DCF analysis, investors would theoretically be willing to pay
\$13.55 per share, indicating that a \$12 share price is relatively low and that
Mayweather's common stock would be a good buy at this time.

### Advantages and Limitations of the DCF Model

- Analysts increasingly use cash flow for corporate valuations due to accounting
scandals, but it's not always the best financial health measure.
- Companies can artificially create positive cash flow by selling assets, which
is not sustainable. Reinvestment of cash is generally preferred over holding
idle cash.
- The DCF model's accuracy depends on the accuracy of its inputs, including cash
flow estimates and discount rate.
- Using various methods for company valuation reduces the risk of inaccuracies.
- It is advisable to use several different methods when valuing companies and
their common stock to avoid inaccuracies.

## Preferred Stock

- Preferred stock, a unique equity type, offers preferential ownership claims
and often features dividends paid before common stockholders.
- Preferred shareholders have asset priority in cases of bankruptcy or
liquidation.
- Preferred stock has a stated par value but no maturity date, with no final par
value payment unless the company ends operations or retires the stock.
- Many preferred stocks are cumulative, meaning that any missed cash dividends
become a liability that the company must pay out to preferred shareholders
eventually. Some preferred stocks may be noncumulative, with skipped dividends
lost forever.
- Preferred stock can be converted into common stock in the future.
- Preferred stocks are more similar to bonds due to their constant dividends,
facilitating valuation with dividend models.
- The intrinsic value of preferred stock can be determined with the perpetuity
formula.

$$
\text{Stock Value} = \frac{\text{Dividend}}{\text{Required Rate of Return}}
$$

### Numerical Example

- Data Forge Inc. has just issued preferred stock (cumulative) with a par value
of \$100.00 and an annual dividend rate of 7%.
- The preferred stock is currently selling for \$35.00 per share.
- What is the yield or return on this preferred stock?

**Solution:**

- The first step is to determine the annual dividend by multiplying the dividend
rate by the par value:

$$
\$100 \times 0.07 = \$7.00
$$

- Now, using this \$7.00 annual dividend, the \$35.00 current price, and the
equation above, we calculate the rate of return as follows:

$$
r = \frac{\$7.00}{\$35.00} = 0.20 \text{ or } 20\%
$$

### Differences between Preferred and Common Stock

| Feature            | Common Stock                                                                 | Preferred Stock                                                        |
|:------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Dividends          | Paid only after preferred stockholders are paid                              | Highest priority, paid first                                          |
| Dividends          | Variable and may increase or decrease                                        | Predetermined rates, so constant dividend amounts                      |
| Growth             | High potential but tied to company performance                               | No growth                                                                  |
| Liquidation        | Paid out last, after all creditors and preferred stockholders are paid       | Given preference in terms of payments, similar to bonds               |
| Voting Rights      | Yes                                                                          | No                                                                    |
| Arrears            | No accrual of missed dividends                                               | If cumulative, unpaid dividends become liability that must be paid out eventually |
| Certainty          | Dividends potentially not paid if company earns no profits                   | Dividends paid even when company experiences financial losses         |

## Efficient Markets

- Efficient markets refer to those where costs are minimal, prices are current,
and fair to all traders.
- Operational efficiency pertains to the speed and accuracy of processing a buy
or sell order at the best available price.
- Historically, operational efficiency has been promoted due to market
competition.
- Public access to the best available prices is evidence of operational
efficiency in the stock markets.

### Informational Efficiency

- Informational efficiency refers to how swiftly a market reflects comprehensive
information in the available trading prices.
- An efficient price is one where all available information has been used to set
it, implying stocks always trade at their fair value.
- If an investor doesn't receive the most current information, they're at a
trading disadvantage due to "stale" prices.
- If the markets are efficient and that it's difficult or impossible to achieve consistently higher than average returns through trading strategies. 

There are three forms of market efficiency: weak form, semi-strong form, and
strong form, collectively known as the efficient market hypothesis:

1. **Weak Form Efficiency**: This form assumes that all past market prices
and data are fully reflected in securities prices. Therefore, technical
analysis, which uses charts of price patterns or trading volumes, cannot be
used to predict and beat a market. The weak form suggests it's impossible to
earn excess returns by looking at past prices or patterns.
2. **Semi-Strong Form Efficiency**: This form suggests that all publicly
available information is immediately incorporated into securities prices. This
not only includes past prices, but all public data (financial statements,
economic factors, etc.). It implies that neither technical nor fundamental
analysis can be used to achieve superior gains. Any new information released
to the public is rapidly incorporated into prices, which adjust
instantaneously.
3. **Strong Form Efficiency**: This is the strongest version of EMH and
suggests that all information - public and private (or insider information) -
is fully reflected in stock prices. In other words, even insiders who have
access to new, non-public information cannot use this data to earn excess
returns. This form is highly controversial and generally believed to be
unrealistic, as it implies perfect markets with no trading costs or barriers
to information, and that all market participants receive and process all
information exactly the same way.
