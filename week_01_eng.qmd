## What Is Finance?

### Definition of Finance

- Finance is the study of the management, movement, and raising of money.
- It is about understanding the uses and sources of cash, as well as the concept
of risk-reward trade-off.
- Finance is also a tool that can help us be better decision makers.

### Basic Areas in Finance

- Finance is divided into three primary areas: business finance, investments,
and financial markets and institutions.

#### Investments {.unnumbered}

- Investments are products and processes used to create and grow wealth.
- It involves: e.g., financial instruments, regulation, and risk-and-return
opportunities.
- Investments include: e.g., stocks, bonds, futures, options, mutual funds,
ETFs, real assets, etc.

#### Financial Markets and Institutions {.unnumbered}

- Financial markets and institutions include firms and regulatory agencies that
oversee the financial system. 
- They facilitate investment practices and ensure investor and industry safety. 
- In the US, regulatory bodies include the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Securities
Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC).
- In Europe, The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) oversees the
EU's securities market, much like the SEC does in the US. Central banks of
individual countries usually serves as the country's main financial market
supervisory body.
- The finance industry has evolved significantly due to forty years of
deregulation, increased competition, and adaptation to change and innovation. 

### Why We Study Finance

- Finance is essential for economic operations, facilitating things like home
ownership and cashless transactions.
- A strong, independent financial system is vital for capital-based economies,
enabling ease of transactions.
- Studying finance opens up a variety of professional opportunities.
- It is a critical decision-making tool requiring analytical thinking and
understanding of value estimation.
- Knowledge of finance and financial markets broadens investment opportunities,
encompassing traditional avenues like stocks and bonds, as well as modern ones
like financial technology and cryptocurrencies.

### Risk and Return in Finance

- Finance asserts that higher risk leads to higher expected returns, with risk
essentially being uncertainty.
- Finance tries to quantify risk to aid in making appropriate risk-return
tradeoffs, in both everyday life and financial decision-making.
- Individuals are generally risk-averse, implying that they expect higher
returns for taking on more risk.
- Financial risk consists of several components including default risk,
inflation risk, diversifiable (unsystematic) risk, non-diversifiable
(systematic) risk, and political risk.

## The Role of Finance in an Organization

- Finance roles in organizations vary and include:
  - Controllers oversee financial reporting and accounting.
  - Treasurers handle cash flow, manage external financial relationships, and
  borrowing and investment activities.
  - The Vice President of Finance supervises the controller and treasurer and
  focuses on generating thorough reports.
  - The CFO is responsible for making key financial decisions, strategizing
  financial planning, and setting financial goals.
- Financial planning is crucial for providing insights into the organization's
past, present, and future funding needs and achieving business objectives.
- Good financial planning incorporates past, current, and forward-looking income
statements, cash flow statements, balance sheets, forecasting, and financial
analysis tools like ratio analysis.
- Budgeting is a key part of financial planning that focuses on the amount,
sources, and uses of cash.
- Financial forecasting helps manage changes to the budget, navigate deviations
from expected outcomes, and serves as a foundation for future budgets.

## Importance of Data and Technology

- Financial data is crucial for better business and financial decision-making by
both insiders and outsiders of a firm, aiding decisions on financing projects,
undertaking projects, and resource allocation.
- Basic types of financial data include income statements, cash flow statements,
and balance sheets, reflecting historical costs and accounting adjustments. 
- Besides internal data, firms seek external data such as customer and supplier
surveys, market research, creditor agreements, and macroeconomic data.
- Data usage extends from measuring business decisions impact to enabling
strategic planning and motivating teams.

## Careers in Finance

- Finance careers offer lucrative opportunities with a promising job growth
projection.
- Finance skills are applicable to a wide array of fields beyond traditional
finance roles, including management analysis and logistics.
- Traditional finance job roles include financial manager, investment relations
associate, budget analyst, credit analyst, financial analyst, personal financial
advisor, loan officer, insurance underwriter, financial examiner, and finance
professor.
- Financial analysts, vital for financial forecasting and market research,
require a diverse skill set encompassing spreadsheet skills, financial modeling,
and understanding of business processes.
- Business analysts focus more on strategic thinking, process development, and
team building, aiding in strategy formulation and problem-solving using
data-driven approaches.

## Markets and Participants

- The primary market is the market for "new" securities, such as initial public
offerings (IPOs) and seasoned equity offerings (SEOs), which provide direct cash
flow to the firms. 
- The secondary market is for "used" securities, where the trading among
investors provides insights into perceptions of a firm's value. 
- Market players, including dealers, brokers, and financial intermediaries, play
unique roles in facilitating efficient financial transactions.
- Dealers own the securities they buy or sell and make money from trading
volumes and price spreads.
- Brokers facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers, usually earning
commission on sales.
- Financial intermediaries, such as commercial banks or investment companies,
enable easier exchanges between transacting parties.
- Financial intermediaries increase efficiency, provide economies of scale,
specialized knowledge, and are vital for a capitalist economy.

## Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters

- Finance combines economics and accounting, leveraging economic theory,
empirical evidence, and accounting data to guide business decisions.
- Economics studies the allocation of scarce resources and is divided into
microeconomics and macroeconomics.
- Microeconomics focuses on individual entities' decisions, analyzing
incentives, behavior, consumption, supply, and demand. It aids in financial
forecasting, planning, and budgeting.
- Macroeconomics examines group decisions, studying elements like inflation,
income, economic growth, and unemployment. It involves broader variables that
models can't always capture but must be incorporated in financial forecasts.
- Macroeconomic variables like inflation, interest rates, unemployment, economic
growth, the stock market, and government fiscal policy play vital roles in
financial markets and forecasting. 
- Financial decision makers need both micro (bottom-up, tactical) and macro
(top-down, strategic) perspectives to effectively navigate towards strategic
objectives.

## Financial Instruments

### Money Markets and Instruments

- The money market trades in short-term (less than one year), low-risk, highly
liquid securities. Default rates are minimal, and instruments can be quickly
sold in a secondary market.
- Financial institutions, corporations, and governments use the money market for
short-term borrowing and/or lending needs. Transactions are usually large,
exceeding $100,000.
- Treasury bills (T-bills) are government-issued short-term debt instruments.
They are auctioned weekly and are default-risk-free. There's an active secondary
market for T-bills.
- Commercial paper is a short-term, unsecured debt security issued by
corporations and financial institutions to finance short-term needs. Only
highly-rated firms can issue them due to the unsecured nature and limited SEC
oversight.
- Negotiable Certificates of Deposit (NCDs) or jumbo CDs, issued by financial
institutions, are redeemable only at maturity and have a robust secondary
market.
- The Federal Reserve targets the interest rate on federal funds as a
significant monetary policy tool. The federal funds market involves overnight
borrowing and lending among financial institutions.

### Capital Markets and Instruments

- The capital market trades longer-term (longer than one year) financial
instruments with varied default risk and less certain liquidity.
- Instruments are categorized into debt instruments (bond markets) and equity
securities (stock markets).
- The federal government issues Treasury notes and bonds to raise money for
current spending and repay past borrowings. T-notes are longer-term than T-bills
and pay semiannual coupon interest payments.
- State and local governments can issue municipal bonds ("munis"), which carry
more risk than Treasury securities but offer tax-free interest payments.
- Corporations also issue bonds for longer-term financing. A bond contract
specifies the order, timing, and amount of contractual payments.
- Shares of stock represent corporate ownership. Stock cash flows are more
uncertain and risky than bond cash flows due to their unpredictable nature.
Stocks can be traded in organized stock exchanges or in the Over-the-Counter
(OTC) market.

## Concepts of Time and Value

- The choice between saving and spending is essentially a choice between present
and future consumption.
- This decision involves considering short-, intermediate-, and long-term goals.
- Short-term savings focus on the safety of principal, intermediate-term
investments balance return and risk, and long-term investments utilize time to
recover from risks and benefit from compounding returns.
- In business, three types of value are important: book value (historical
costs), market value (price consumers pay), and economic value (what consumers
are willing to pay).

| 10% Annual Return      | Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 | Scenario 3 | Scenario 4 |
|------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Starting investment age| 26         | 19         | 14         | 9          |
| Ending investment age  | 60         | 25         | 18         | 13         |
| Total investments      | 35         | 7          | 5          | 5          |
| Annual investment      | $5,000     | $5,000     | $5,000     | $5,000     |
| Total investment amount| $175,000   | $35,000    | $25,000    | $25,000    |
| Value at age 60        | $1,490,634 | $1,466,369 | $1,838,858 | $2,961,500 |

## Corporate Structure and Governance

- Business goals involve fulfilling personal financial objectives, and in
publicly traded companies, increasing stockholder value.
- Shareholders are individuals seeking a return on investment for personal
long-term financial goals.
- Companies focus on both financial and nonfinancial goals, including sales
expansion, customer satisfaction, and product development.
- Asset value is determined by the present value of future cash flows.
- Maximizing shareholder wealth requires a long-term view and decisions may not
immediately affect stock prices.
- In privately owned entities, the long-term growth and value maximization is
equally important to the owners.

## Business Structures

- The four common forms of business organizations are sole proprietorships,
partnerships, corporations, and hybrids like LLCs and LLPs.
- Sole proprietorships are unincorporated businesses owned by a single person
with advantages such as simplicity and fewer regulations but also have unlimited
personal liability.
- Partnerships involve a legal arrangement between two or more people, offering
diverse expertise and easier capital collection but also carry unlimited
personal liability.
- Corporations are a separate legal entity from their owners and managers,
offering advantages such as unlimited life, easier capital raising, and limited
owners' losses, but subject to double taxation.
- Hybrid forms like LLCs and LLPs have elements of both a corporation and a
partnership, providing principals with liability protection and are taxed as
partnerships.
- An organization must evaluate the pros and cons when choosing its structure,
including the ability to raise funds, the effects of taxation, and liquidity.

## Relationship between Shareholders and Company Management

- A stakeholder is anyone with an interest in an organization’s outcomes (e.g.,
employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers, communities, and governments).
- Shareholders are individuals, companies, or organizations that hold stock in a
company. They receive dividends, vote on company matters, and may be elected to
the board of directors. 
- There are two types of shareholders: common and preferred. Common shareholders
own the company’s common stock and have voting rights, while preferred
shareholders own preferred stock, receive fixed dividends, but do not have
voting rights.
- Directors, hired by shareholders, guide company strategy, differing from
shareholders who are owners.
- A shareholder is a company owner, while a stakeholder is someone dependent on
the company's performance, possibly non-financially.
- Corporations are overseen by a board of directors (BOD) at the highest level,
while day-to-day operations are handled by mid-level managers.
- Management should have a long-term focus on meeting growth targets and
corporate objectives; short-term focus can hinder the long-term health of the
company.

## Agency Issues: Shareholders and Corporate Boards

- Agency problems occur when a manager uses their position for personal gain
instead of acting in the best interest of the shareholders. This can negatively
impact company profits and shareholder goodwill.
- Three types of agency problems include: Stockholders versus Management,
Investors versus Creditors, and Stockholders versus Other Stakeholders.
- Segregation of ownership and management can help to avoid agency problems but
can also lead to self-serving decisions by external managers.
- Creditors may devalue a company's debts if it undertakes risky investments,
leading to agency problems between investors and creditors.
- Shareholders might conflict with other stakeholders in a company, like
employees, leading to declining business performance.
- Solutions to agency problems include offering incentives for ethical behavior,
penalizing poor performance, and aligning goals of management and ownership.
- The threat of a hostile takeover can also discourage agency problems by making
management act in the best interests of shareholders.
- Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings, provided by third-party
organizations, are being increasingly used by the investment community to
evaluate companies. High ESG ratings can indicate proactive management and
potential long-term value.

## Interacting with Investors, Intermediaries, and Other Market Participants

- Investor Relations (IR) is a corporate public relations subdivision aimed at
maintaining open relationships with shareholders.
- IR, with strict regulatory obligations, requires close collaboration with
legal and accounting departments.
- Responsibilities include organizing shareholder meetings, disseminating
financial data, conducting briefings, and managing financial disclosure issues.
- Regular quarterly earnings conference calls and reports provide transparency
to the investment community.
- Annual shareholder meetings and investment conferences are important for
effective investor relations, requiring a clear and engaging investment story.
- Press releases, a crucial tool in IR, convey various corporate news and should
be easily understandable and multimedia-enhanced when possible.

## Companies in Domestic and Global Markets

- Domestic companies operate primarily within the US, adhering to US accounting
and securities laws, with financial reporting using Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP).
- International firms are US-based but have significant international
operations, with parent company accounting adhering to GAAP, while non-US
subsidiaries may follow host country laws and regulations.
- Global firms operate in various countries, with corporate governance
determined by the laws of the parent company's country, and financial reporting
usually follows International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
- GAAP and IFRS, although designed to provide unbiased financial reporting,
differ significantly, impacting areas like inventory accounting, subsidiary
consolidation, and minority interest reporting.
