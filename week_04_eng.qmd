## Characteristics of Bonds

### Bonds as Investments

- An investor buying a bond is lending money to the issuer, such as a
corporation or government.
- The issuer promises to repay the original loan and interest (coupon payments)
at a specific maturity date.
- Coupon payments offset the delay of principal repayment, considering the time
value of money.
- Bonds, like stocks and mutual funds, are essential financial instruments that
provide portfolio safety and diversity.
- Investors buying bonds are essentially purchasing a promised future cash flow
stream from the bond issuer.
- Bonds, often termed as fixed-income securities, offer a predetermined cash
inflow, fixed at the time of the bond sale.
- Despite being a straightforward form of investment, bonds have unique and
extensive terminology.
- **An example:** If an investor buys a \$1,000 bond from Apple Inc. at 5%
annual interest for 20 years, the investor is the lender and Apple Inc. is the
borrower.

### Basic terminology

- **Par value:** Also known as face amount or value, it's the principal amount
that the issuer will repay at maturity. For example, a \$1,000 bond has a par
value of \$1,000.
- **Coupon rate:** The interest rate used to calculate the bond's periodic
interest or coupon payments, expressed in annual terms. For example, a 5%
interest rate is the coupon rate.
- **Coupon payment:** Regular interest payment on the bond, calculated by
multiplying the par value by the coupon rate. For example, a $1,000 bond with a
5% interest rate will have an annual coupon payment of $50.
- **Maturity date:** The bond's expiration date when the issuer pays the final
interest payment and the principal. For example, a bond with a term of 20 years
has a maturity date 20 years after issuance.
- **Yield to Maturity (YTM):** The discount rate used to calculate the present
value of a bond's future cash flows, representing the return if the bond is held
to maturity. The YTM indicates the overall investment value of a bond. Its
computation is discussed later.
- **Callable Feature:** States whether or not the bond has a call feature (if it
can be retired or ended before its normal maturity date).
- **Rating:** A grade that indicates credit quality.

### Types of Bonds

- **Government Bonds:**
    - US Treasury bills (T-bills) are short-term and considered the safest, backed
    by the US government.
    - Treasury notes have maturities from one to 10 years, and Treasury bonds mature
    in 10 to 30 years.
- **Savings Bonds:**
    - They are bought to finance certain government programs.
    - The buyer loans money to the government, ensuring the return of face value
    plus interest.
    - Due to the government backing, they are low-risk and offer relatively low
    returns.
- **Municipal Bonds:**
    - Issued by cities, states, or their agencies.
    - Slightly riskier than Treasury bills, but typically offer a bit higher
    returns.
- **Corporate Bonds:**
    - Issued by companies and carry higher risk than government bonds, as
    corporations can't raise taxes to fund their bonds.
    - The risk and return depend on the company's creditworthiness.
    - High-risk, high-return corporate bonds are often called junk bonds.
    - Zero-coupon bonds don't make regular interest payments and are issued at a
    discount, repaying full par value at maturity.
    - Convertible bonds can be converted into a predetermined number of common
    stock shares at certain times, usually at the bondholder's discretion.

### The Global Bond Market versus the Global Stock Market

- The global bond market, including sovereign and corporate bonds, is
significantly larger than the global stock market, though comparing only
corporate bonds to the stock market may be more relevant.
- Total value of bond markets still surpasses that of stocks, but stock markets
are growing in size due to traditionally higher returns, making them more
attractive despite higher risk.

- A bond investment has two sides: payment of the par value at maturity and
periodic coupon payments, both of which are contractually determined.
- Bond valuation involves separate present value calculations for these two
types of inflow.
- Bond price and interest rates have an inverse relationship. When interest
rates fall, bond prices rise, and vice versa. The exception is floating-rate
bonds, whose rates are tied to a benchmark and adjust with economic changes.

![](images/fig_4_2.webp){width=500 fig-align="center"}

- Investors in fixed-rate bonds may see their investments lose value if interest
rates rise, unlike those in variable-rate bonds.
- Deep discount bonds, including zero-coupon bonds, have very low coupon rates
and see larger price changes when interest rates shift.

## Bond Valuation

### General Framework for Bond Valuation

1. **Determine the Cash Flows**: Identify the periodic coupon payments and the
face value of the bond, which will be repaid at maturity.
2. **Discount the Cash Flows**: Each future cash flow is discounted back to its
present value.
3. **Sum the Present Values**: Add up all the present values to obtain the bond
price.

- The formula to calculate the present value (PV) of a bond is:

$$
PV = C \times \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r} + FV \times (1 + r)^{-n}
$$

- where:
    - $PV$ is the present value or price of the bond
    - $C$ is the annual coupon payment
    - $r$ is the yield to maturity (YTM) or discount rate
    - $n$ is the number of periods until maturity
    - $FV$ is the face value of the bond

### Numerical Example

- Assume a bond with:
    - Annual coupon payment $C = \$100$
    - Yield to maturity $r = 5\%$ or $0.05$
    - Number of periods until maturity $n = 10$ years
    - Face value of the bond $FV = \$1000$

- Let's calculate the bond price:

$$
PV = 100 \times \frac{1 - (1 + 0.05)^{-10}}{0.05} + 1000 \times (1 + 0.05)^{-10}
$$

- Calculate the two components:
    - The present value of the coupon payments: 
    $$
    100 \times \frac{1 - (1 + 0.05)^{-10}}{0.05} = \$772.17
    $$
    - The present value of the face value: 
    $$
    1000 \times (1 + 0.05)^{-10} = \$613.91
    $$
    - Add these two components together:
    $$
    PV = \$772.17 + \$613.91 = \$1386.08
    $$

- So, the price of the bond should be approximately \$1386.08.

### Different Coupon Payment Frequency

- Assume a bond with:
    - Monthly coupon payment $C = \$10$ (this would equate to an annual payment
    of $120$ if the bond is paying 12 times a year)
    - Annual yield to maturity $r = 6\%$ or $0.06$ (We need to convert this to a
    monthly rate by dividing by 12, so $r_{monthly} = 0.06/12 = 0.005$)
    - Number of periods until maturity $n = 5$ years, but since coupons are paid
    monthly, we have $n_{monthly} = 5 \times 12 = 60$ months
    - Face value of the bond $FV = \$1000$

- Let's calculate the bond price:

$$
PV = 10 \times \frac{1 - (1 + 0.005)^{-60}}{0.005} + 1000 \times (1 + 0.005)^{-60}
$$
$$
PV = \$487.51 + \$740.74 = \$1228.25
$$

- So, the price of the bond should be approximately $1228.25.

### The Relationship of Yield to Maturity and Coupon Rate

- The price or value of a bond is directly influenced by its Yield to Maturity
(YTM) and coupon rate. 
- A bond sells at a premium (higher than its par value) when the coupon rate is
greater than the YTM. Such bonds are termed **premium bonds**.
- If the coupon rate is lower than the YTM, the bond sells at a discount (lower
than its par value), making it a **discount bond**.
- Bonds that sell at their par value occur when the coupon rate and YTM are
equal. These bonds are referred to as **par value bonds**.
- There's an inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices, which
is crucial for investors to understand because changes in interest rates can
significantly affect the value of bonds.

## Using the Yield Curve

### Term Structure of Interest Rates

- The term structure of interest rates shows the expected yields of bonds over
various maturity periods.
- The yield curve is a graphical representation of this, with yield on the
y-axis and time period on the x-axis.

![](images/fig_4_4.webp){width=300 fig-align="center"}

- To construct a useful yield curve, yields for all remaining times to maturity
of government bonds should be calculated.
- A normal yield curve is upward-sloping, with yield increasing as the term
increases. This reflects the increased risk associated with longer maturity
periods for fixed-income investments such as bonds.
- Corporate bonds generally offer higher yields than government bonds because of
their greater risk of default.

### Different Shapes of the Yield Curve

- The shape of the yield curve is defined by its level and slope. The level
corresponds to yield rates, while the slope indicates the difference between
short-term and long-term yields, largely dictated by market expectations and
uncertainty about future interest rates.
- A positive yield curve suggests higher returns for long-term investments,
often seen in economic expansion when investors expect rising inflation and
interest rates.
- A flat yield curve indicates similar yields for short and long-term
investments, typically during transition phases in the economy or due to certain
monetary policies.
- An inverted yield curve is considered as a signal for upcoming recession.

- An example of inverted yield curves caused by COVID-19 pandemic.

![](images/fig_4_7.webp){width=500 fig-align="center"}

- Market professionals closely monitor the yield curve due to its importance as
an economic indicator. It reflects market expectations and attitudes of
individual and institutional investors, influencing investment markets and the
economy.

## Risks of Interest Rates and Default

### Bond Risks

- **Default (Credit) risk** refers to the risk associated with the issuer's
inability to meet its payment commitments. This is lower for government bonds
due to their relative stability.
- **Interest rate risk** is the risk of bond values falling when interest rates
rise. It generally increases the longer an investor holds a bond.
- **Liquidity risk** relates to the difficulty in selling a bond. 
- **Duration risk** pertains to a bond's price sensitivity to changes in
interest rates. The higher the duration, the more sensitive the bond is to
interest rate changes.
- **Call risk** and reinvestment risk involve bonds being redeemed before their
maturity dates, potentially leading to investors having to reinvest in
lower-yield options.
- **Term risk** arises from investors demanding higher returns for lending funds
at fixed interest rates, due to the risks presented by rising interest rates.

### Bond Ratings and Rating Providers

- Bond ratings are published to help investors understand these risks, with U.S.
Treasury securities generally considered free of default risk, but corporate
bonds typically facing some possibility of default.
- Bond ratings services help investors assess the default risks of bonds, with
agencies evaluating bonds based on available information and assigning grades to
each bond and its issuer.
- The three largest bond rating providers are Fitch Ratings, Moody's Investors
Service, and Standard & Poor’s (S&P) Global Ratings. These services use a rating
system that categorizes the highest quality bonds as AAA, followed by AA, and so
on.
- Bonds rated BBB (S&P, Fitch) / Baa (Moody’s) or higher are considered
investment-grade bonds, indicating strong stability. These are popular as many
banks and pension funds can only trade investment-grade bonds.
- Bonds rated lower than BBB or Baa are known as high-yield bonds or junk bonds.
These bonds carry higher risk and have seen fluctuating success, with market
collapses and brief resurgences.
- Bond ratings are judgments about a corporation's future ability to repay debt
and their growth prospects.
- Some financial analysts use financial ratios of the issuing firm, such as
company debt ratio, earnings-to-interest ratio, and return on assets, to predict
potential ratings.

| S&P / Fitch | Moody’s | Grade       | Meaning                          |
|:-----------:|:-------:|:-----------:|:--------------------------------:|
| AAA         | Aaa     | Investment  | Risk almost zero                 |
| AA          | Aa      | Investment  | Low risk                         |
| A           | A       | Investment  | Risky if economy declines        |
| BBB         | Baa     | Investment  | Some risk; more if economy declines |
| BB          | Ba      | Speculative | Risky                            |
| B           | B       | Speculative | Risky; expected to get worse     |
| CCC         | Caa     | Speculative | Probably bankruptcy              |
| CC          | Ca      | Speculative | Probably bankruptcy              |
| C           | C       | Speculative | In bankruptcy or default          |
| D           |         | Speculative | In bankruptcy or default          |

### Concepts of Bond Returns

- Bond investors earn profits through interest income and capital gains.
Interest income is governed by the bond's coupon rate, and capital gains or
losses occur when the bond is sold in the secondary market.
- If interest rates change significantly, the investor may have to adjust the
price of their bond to match market rates, potentially leading to a capital gain
or loss.
- A strategy called bond laddering, where investments are spread across bonds
with different maturity dates, is commonly used to balance risk and return, and
maintain regular cash inflows.
- The bond's value has an inverse relationship with interest rates, meaning bond
prices fall as interest rates rise and vice versa. Factors like interest rates,
maturity periods, taxability of bond interest, credit standing of issuers, and
likelihood of bond call all influence bond values.
