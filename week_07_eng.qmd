## Risk and Return to an Individual Asset

### Measuring Historical Returns

- Risk and return are crucial for investment decisions. 
- Return is the expected profit from an investment, while risk is the
uncertainty of the return.
- To assess a single asset like a stock, historical return measures are used.
- Comparing historical returns across different investments helps in decision
making.

#### Individual Investment Realized Return

- Suppose that you purchased a share of Target (TGT) at the beginning of January
2020 for \$128.74.
- At the end of the year, you sold the stock for \$176.53.
- You also received \$2.68 in dividends during 2020.
- **Total dollar return** can be calculated as:

$$
\text{Total Dollar Return} = \text{Dividend Income} + \text{Capital Gain}
$$

$$
\text{Total Dollar Return} = 2.68 + (176.53 - 128.74) = 2.68 + 47.79 = \$50.47 
$$

- It is common to express investment returns in percentage terms rather than
dollar terms.

$$
\text{Dividend Yield} = \frac{\text{Dividend Income}}{\text{Initial Stock Price}} = \frac{2.68}{128.74} \times 100 = 2.08\% 
$$
$$
\text{Capital Gain Yield} = \frac{\text{Capital Gain}}{\text{Initial Stock Price}} = \frac{47.79}{128.74} \times 100 = 37.12\% 
$$
$$
\text{Total Percent Return} = \frac{\text{Total Dollar Return}}{\text{Initial Stock Price}} = \frac{50.47}{128.74} \times 100 = 39.20\% 
$$

- Your total percent return of 39.20% means that you made $0.392 for every
dollar invested when your gains from both dividends and stock price appreciation
are totaled together.

#### Annualizing Investment Returns

- Holding periods for invdividual investments can differ.
- To compare them to other investment opportunities, you need to express returns
on a per-year, or annualized, basis.
- The holding period returned is converted to an effective annual rate (EAR)
using the formula:

$$
\text{EAR} = (1 + \text{Holding Period Percentage Return})^m -1
$$

- where $m$ is the number of holding periods in a year.
- E.g., you earned 14.62\% in three months:

$$
\text{EAR} = (1 + 0.1462)^4 - 1 = 0.7260 = 72.60\%
$$

- E.g., you earned 183.22\% in five years:

$$
\text{EAR} = (1 + 1.8322)^{\frac{1}{5}} - 1 = 0.2315 = 23.15\%
$$

- The compounded annual return derived from the EAR is also known as a geometric
average return.
- Using arithmetic average for calculating average return is often misleading
due to compounding issues.
- Arithmetic average is usually much higher than geometric average.
- Both arithmetic average return and geometric average return provide correct
but different insights.
- The geometric average reflects the actual annual compounded return, useful for
understanding overall investment growth over time.
- The arithmetic average illustrates the typical yearly return, aiding in
predicting expected returns for a specific year.

### Measuring Risk

- Risk in finance is usually associated with uncertainty.
- The most common measure of risk is volatility of returns, measured as a
standard deviation.
- The larger the standard deviation, the greater this range of returns is.
- Thus, a larger standard deviation indicates a greater volatility of returns
and, hence, more risk.
- The larger the standard deviation of a stock’s annual returns, the further
from the average that stock’s return is likely to be in any given year.
- In other words, the return for the stock is highly unpredictable.
- Stock returns are volatile due to fluctuating expectations of a company's
future revenues and expenses.
- Expectations can change due to various events or new information about the
company.
- Positive news like expansion plans or cost reduction strategies can boost the
company's stock price by increasing revenue or profit expectations.
- Conversely, news that indicates increased costs or decreased revenues, such as
employee salary hikes, can decrease a company's stock price by negatively
affecting profit expectations.


## Risk and Return to Multiple Assets

### Diversification

- Investors often hold a portfolio of stocks rather than just one to mitigate
risk through diversification.
- Diversification involves owning a variety of stocks in a portfolio, protecting
against extreme outcomes linked to a single stock's performance.
- Diversification is like spreading eggs across multiple baskets to avoid losing
them all if one basket breaks.
- As investors diversify, the volatility of a single stock becomes less
significant because gains and losses across different stocks can offset each
other.
- The correlation between stocks in a portfolio also affects its volatility;
less correlation between stocks leads to decreased risk.
- Stocks in the same industry often have a high correlation, limiting the risk
reduction achieved by diversification within the same industry.
- Diversifying across industries, especially those that are less correlated, can
lead to a significant decrease in portfolio risk.

### Portfolio Size and Risk

- Portfolio diversification decreases volatility and firm-specific risk,
protecting investors from significant impact due to adverse events related to a
single company.
- Systematic risk, linked to broader market or economic changes, remains
irrespective of how diversified the portfolio is and can't be eliminated.
- Portfolio's standard deviation, a measure of risk, drops quickly as the number
of stocks in the portfolio increases but less so as the portfolio size further
increases.
- There isn't a consensus on the exact number of stocks needed for a
well-diversified portfolio. The degree of diversification also depends on the
correlation between the stocks.
- A portfolio heavily concentrated in one industry isn't very diversified, even
if it contains multiple stocks. 
- An average investor can create a reasonably diversified portfolio with around
a dozen stocks.

## The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

### Risk-Free Rate

- The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) suggests that investors should receive
higher rewards for holding stocks with higher systematic risk.
- CAPM focuses on systematic risk since firm-specific risk can be mitigated
through diversification.
- Lending money to the US government, by purchasing US Treasury securities, is
considered a low-risk investment, often referred to as risk-free.
- The return rate from US Treasury securities serves as a proxy for the
risk-free rate and a benchmark for investing.
- The average return rate for three-month US Treasury security from 1928 to 2020
was 3.36% with a low standard deviation, implying low volatility.
- Unlike stock returns, the return on US Treasury bills has never been negative,
signifying their lower risk.

### Risk Premium

- When investing in stocks instead of risk-free US Treasury bills, there's
potential for higher gains, but also for losses. This risk is undertaken for
potentially higher rewards.
- The average return for the S&P 500 stock index from 1928 to 2020 was 11.64%,
significantly higher than the 3.36% return from US Treasury bills, albeit with a
higher volatility.
- The additional return you earn for bearing risk, above the return of risk-free
investments, is known as the **risk premium**.
- The risk premium is calculated as the difference between the return on risky
investments (like stocks) and the return on risk-free investments (like US
Treasury securities).

$$
\text{Risk Premium} = \text{S\&P 500 Avg Return} - \text{US T-Bill Avg Return}
$$

$$
\text{Risk Premium} = 11.64\% - 3.36\% = 8.28\%
$$

### Beta

- The risk relevant to investors is systematic risk, which cannot be eliminated
through diversification. Investors are rewarded for bearing systematic risk.
- Beta measures the systematic risk of a stock, showing how much it moves in
relation to the market. A beta of 1 means a stock moves with the market. 
- Stocks with a beta greater than 1 have more pronounced moves in the same
direction as the market, thus are riskier.
- Stocks with a beta less than 1 experience smaller swings than the overall
market and are considered less risky.

### CAPM Equation

- The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a theoretical model that describes
the relationship between risk and expected return of an investment.
- The model suggests that the expected return on an investment is equal to the
risk-free rate plus a risk premium.
- The risk premium is based on the beta of the investment, which measures the
systematic risk of the investment relative to the overall market.
- CAPM is extensively utilized for pricing risky securities and generating
expected returns for assets considering their risk level and the cost of
capital.
- The general Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) equation is written as:

$$
r_i = r_f + \beta_i (r_m - r_f)
$$

- Where:
    - $r_i$ is the expected return on the investment,
    - $r_f$ is the risk-free rate,
    - $\beta_i$ is the beta of the investment, and
    - $r_m$ is the expected return of the market.

## Applications in Performance Measurement

### Sharpe Ratio

- The Sharpe Ratio is a measure used to understand the return of an investment
compared to its risk. 
- Developed by Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe, the ratio measures the excess
return (or Risk Premium) per unit of deviation in an investment asset or a
trading strategy.
- The general formula for the Sharpe ratio is: 
$$
\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{(R_p - R_f)}{SD_p}
$$

- Where:
  - $S$ is the Sharpe Ratio
  - $R_p$ is the expected portfolio return
  - $R_f$ is the risk-free rate
  - $SD_p$ is the standard deviation of the portfolio (the portfolio's risk)
- Let's consider a numerical example:
  - Suppose an investment portfolio has an expected return of 15%
  - The risk-free rate is 3%
  - The portfolio's standard deviation is 10%
  - The Sharpe ratio would be calculated as follows:

  $$
  S = \frac{(0.15 - 0.03)}{0.10} = 1.2
  $$
  - The Sharpe ratio of 1.2 implies that the investment will have a return of
  1.2 units for each unit of risk assumed over the risk-free rate.
- It is widely used to compare the return on investment considering the risk
undertaken.
- Higher the Sharpe ratio, better is the risk-adjusted return provided
by the investment.

### Treynor Ratio

- The Treynor Ratio, named after Jack Treynor, is a measurement of the returns
earned in excess of that which could have been earned on a riskless investment
per each unit of market risk. 
- Similar to the Sharpe Ratio, the Treynor Ratio measures the risk premium per
unit of risk. However, the Treynor Ratio uses beta (market risk) instead of
standard deviation (total risk).
- It is typically used to compare the risk-adjusted performance of multiple
portfolios or funds. A higher Treynor Ratio indicates a more desirable
performance.
- The general formula for the Treynor ratio is: 

$$
\text{Traynor Ratio} = \frac{(R_p - R_f)}{\beta_p}
$$

- Where:
  - $R_p$ is the expected portfolio return
  - $R_f$ is the risk-free rate
  - $\beta_p$ is the portfolio's beta (the portfolio's market risk)
- Let's consider a numerical example:
  - Suppose an investment portfolio has an expected return of 20%
  - The risk-free rate is 5%
  - The portfolio's beta is 1.5
  - The Treynor ratio would be calculated as follows:
  $$
  \text{Treynor Ratio} = \frac{(0.20 - 0.05)}{1.5} = 0.10
  $$
  - A Treynor Ratio of 0.10 implies that the investment portfolio is expected to
  return 10% in excess of the risk-free rate for each unit of market risk.

### Jensen’s Alpha

- Jensen's Alpha, named after Michael Jensen, is a risk-adjusted performance
measure that represents the average return on a portfolio over and above that
predicted by the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), given the portfolio's beta
and the average market return.
- It is used to determine the excess return provided by a portfolio manager over
a certain benchmark return.
- The general formula for Jensen's Alpha is:

$$
\text{Jensen's Aplha} = R_p - [R_f + \beta_p * (R_m - R_f)]
$$

- Where:
  - $R_p$ is the portfolio's return
  - $R_f$ is the risk-free rate
  - $R_m$ is the return of the market
  - $\beta_p$ is the portfolio's beta
- Let's consider a numerical example:
  - Suppose an investment portfolio has an actual return of 25%
  - The risk-free rate is 5%
  - The market return is 15%
  - The portfolio's beta is 1.2
  - Jensen's Alpha would be calculated as follows:
  $$
  \text{Jensen's Aplha} = 0.25 - [0.05 + 1.2 * (0.15 - 0.05)] = 0.25 - 0.17 = 0.08
  $$
    - Jensen's Alpha of 0.08 implies that the portfolio's return is 8% higher
    than the return predicted by the CAPM given its beta.
    - The positive alpha indicates that the portfolio manager has outperformed
    the benchmark.
